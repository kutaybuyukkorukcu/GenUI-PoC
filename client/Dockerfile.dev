# Development Dockerfile for Frontend
FROM node:22-alpine AS development

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (better layer caching)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
# This layer will be cached unless package.json changes
RUN npm install

# Note: Source code is NOT copied here in dev mode
# It will be mounted as a volume from docker-compose.override.yml
# This ensures hot reload works and node_modules stays intact

# Expose Vite dev server port
EXPOSE 5173

# Default command (will be overridden in docker-compose.override.yml)
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
